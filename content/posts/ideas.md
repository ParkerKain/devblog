I am going to use this post to mark down ideas I have for blogs and projects to build - and hopefully over time they will link out to me actually doing those things!

## Project Ideas

* The `parknotes` project for note taking in the terminal - ongoing likely forever. [Link here!](https://github.com/ParkerKain/parknotes)
* Working through Rustlings
* Understanding Datafusion and it's place amongst polars and spark
* Making a TUI for different data structures
* Krogle - a Wordle clone using public Kroger APIs. I am an employee of corporate Kroger should I should be well equipped to do something fun/cool with the data.
* Daily typing test CLI - AWS hosted app that creates a typing test every day that people can do in the terminal, and then times are visible online. Fun for a daily little game against your friends!
* Build something in Rust/Go/Python and compare the experience - maybe start with 10 days of Advent of Code
## Blog Ideas
* The impact of AI Code Assistants on learning - how do junior devs learn the ropes in a world where Copilot does the "menial" work?
* My work stack - neovim + kitty + Colemak split keyboard, and what I get out of these
* Commentary on recent "[scalable programming languages](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39988345)" post I saw on hackernews
* Comparison of kitty to alacritty + zellij
