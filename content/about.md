# Hello - I'm Parker!

I am:

* A Lead Data Scientist at [84.51](https://www.8451.com/) since 2019
* An incoming [OMSCS Student at Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)
* Pretty solid at Python, but looking to learn more low level / full stack skills
* A husband and dog dad!

## Goals for this Blog and my learning

I have been inspired by the classic [Learn in Public blog](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
to admit I will never be "good enough" in my own eyes to start writing
and contributing back to open source and the developer community. I have some
things I'm good at, and a lot more I want to learn, and the best time for me
to start is right now.

The main focus for me right now is in learning more low level stuff, 
specifically Rust!

## My dev environment

Obligatory "I'm on Arch BTW" and "I code in Neovim BTW". I do these things
not because I am smart, but because I am dumb and want to learn them better.
I am confident my Arch setup will explode in a ball of flames one day, and I
eagerly await writing the blog post on how I **tried** to put it out.

You can find my dotfiles - which I regularly start over completely from scratch,
[here](https://github.com/ParkerKain/dotfiles)
